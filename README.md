**!!NOT MY GAME!! - ALL CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL OWNERS - Muder mystery based RenPy game**

List of changes I made I thought would benefit the game :)
- Added previous text to still display when making a choice
- Fixed a bug with Sapphire's route not triggering properly
- Changed color of text when selecting an option to be more readable
- Unlocked all routes for the unfinished characters (Right before the date scene - Fancy bar is option to continue game) (thought it would be funny lol, can just comment them out again)

Good game guys, I enjoyed it ^^
